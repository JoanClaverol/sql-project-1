Data description:
This database belongs to a Brazilian e-commerce marketplace that connects sellers with customers.
Whenever an order is placed:
- if the customer is new, a customer_id is generated and a row is inserted on the customers table.
- an order_id is generated, and row is inserted on the order table.
- as many rows as different products being sold are inserted on the order-items table.
- if a payment is made, a row is inserted on the payments table

Answer the questions below, as if they were asked by a Manager to inform strategic decision making.
Provide the SQL code you used to answer them and a written answer with any needed explanation.


In relation to the products:

How many different products are being sold?
What are the most popular categories?
How popular are tech products compared to other categories?
What’s the average price of the products being sold?
Are expensive tech products popular?
What’s the average monthly revenue of Magist’s sellers?

-----
In relation to the sellers:

- How many sellers are there?
Making any assumptions you need, calculate the revenue that sellers are making:
  - What’s the average revenue of all the sellers?
  - What’s the average revenue of sellers that sell tech products?

-----
In relation to the delivery time:
  - What’s the average time between the order being placed and the product being delivered?
  - How many orders are delivered on time vs orders delivered with a delay?
  - Is there any pattern for delayed orders, e.g. big products being delayed more often?
